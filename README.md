# SAFE CLI
This crate implements a CLI (Command Line Interface) for the SAFE Network.

For further information please see https://safenetforum.org/t/safe-cli-high-level-design-document/28690

## Build

In order to build this CLI from source code you need to make sure you have `rustc v1.35.0` (or higher) installed. Please take a look at this [notes about Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you need help with installing it. We recommend you install it with `rustup` which will install `cargo` tool since this guide makes use of it.

Once Rust and its toolchain are installed, run the following commands to clone this repository and build the `safe_cli` crate (the build process may take several minutes the first time you run it on this crate):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-cli.git
$ cd safe-cli
$ cargo build
```
