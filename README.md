## Build

In order to build this CLI from source code you need to make sure you have `rustc v1.35.0` (or higher) installed. Please take a look at this [notes about Rust installation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you need help with installing it. We recommend you install it with `rustup` which will install `cargo` tool since this guide makes use of it.

Once Rust and its toolchain are installed, run the following commands to clone this repository and build the `safe_cli` crate (the build process may take several minutes the first time you run it on this crate):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-cli.git
$ cd safe-cli
$ cargo build
```

## Using the CLI

Right now the CLI is under active development. Here we're listing commands ready to be tested (against mock).

The base command, if built is `$ safe_cli`, or all commands can be run via `$ cargo run -- <command>`.

Various global flags are available (those commented out are not yet implemented):

```bash
# --dry-run              Dry run of command. No data will be written. No coins spent.
-h, --help               Prints help information
--pretty                 Print human readable responses. (Alias to --output human-readable.)
# --root                 The account's Root Container address
-V, --version            Prints version information
# -v, --verbose          Increase output verbosity. (More logs!)
# -o, --output <output>  Output data serlialisation
# -q, --query <query>    Enable to query the output via SPARQL eg.
--xorurl <xorurl_base>   Base encoding to be used for XOR-URLs generated. Currently supported: base32 (default) and base32z
```

### `--help`

All commands have a `--help` function which will list args, options and subcommands.

### Auth

The CLI is just another client SAFE application, therefore it needs to be authorised by the user to gain access to the SAFE Network on behave of the user. The CLI `auth` command allows us to obtain such authorisation from the account owner (the user) via the SAFE Authenticator.

This command simply sends an authorisation request to the Authenticator available, e.g. the safe_auth CLI daemon (see further bellow for explanation of how to run it), and it then stores the authorisation response (credentials) in `<user's home directory>/.safe/credentials` file. Any subsequent CLI command will read the `~/.safe/credentials` file, to obtain the credentials and connect to the network for the corresponding operation.

##### Prerequisite: run the Authenticator

You need the [SAFE Authenticator CLI](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-authenticator-cli) running locally and exposing its WebService interface for authorising applications, and also be logged in to a SAFE account created on the mock network (i.e. `MockVault` file), making sure the port number you set is `41805`, and enabling the `mock-network` feature.

Please open a second/separate terminal console to execute the following commands (again, please make sure you have `rustc v1.35.0` or higher):
```
$ git clone https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-authenticator-cli.git
$ cd safe-authenticator-cli
$ cargo run --features mock-network -- --daemon 41805
```

### Authorise the safe_cli app

Now that the Authenticator is running and ready to authorise applications, we can simply invoke the `auth` command:
```bash
$ safe_cli auth
```

At this point, you need to authorise the application on the Authenticator, you should see a prompt like the following:
```bash
The following application authorisation request was received:
+------------------+----------+------------------+------------------------+
| Id               | Name     | Vendor           | Permissions requested  |
+------------------+----------+------------------+------------------------+
| net.maidsafe.cli | SAFE CLI | MaidSafe.net Ltd | Own container: false   |
|                  |          |                  | Default containers: {} |
+------------------+----------+------------------+------------------------+
Allow authorisation? [y/N]:
```


### Keys

`Key` management allows users to generate sign/encryption key pairs that can be used for different type of operations, like choosing which sign key to use for uploading files (and therefore paying for the storage used), or signing a message posted on some social application when a Key is linked with a public profile (e.g. a WebID/SAFE-ID), or even for encrypting messages that are privately sent to another party so it can verify the authenticity of the sender.

Users can record `Key`'s in a `Wallet` (see further below for more details about `Wallet`'s), having friendly names to refer to them, but they can also be created as throw away `Key`'s which are not linked from any `Wallet`, container, or any other type of data on the network.

Note that even that the key pair is automatically generated by the CLI, `Key`s donâ€™t hold the secret key on the network but just the public key, and `Key`s optionally can have a safecoin balance attached to it. Thus `Key`'s can also be used for safecoin transactions (again, see the wallet section below for more details).

#### Keys Create

Creates a new `Key` on the network. A `source` address is needed to pay for PUTs
```shell
$ safe_cli keys create <source>

## or via cargo and with test-coins added
$ cargo run -- keys create --test-coins --preload 15.342 --pretty

New Key created at: "safe://bbkulcbnrmdzhdkrfb6zbbf7fisbdn7ggztdvgcxueyq2iys272koaplks"
Key pair generated: pk="b62c1e4e3544a1f64212fca89046df98d998ea615e84c4348c4b5fd29c07ad52a970539df819e31990c1edf09b882e61", sk="c4cc596d7321a3054d397beff82fe64f49c3896a07a349d31f29574ac9f56965"
```

Other optional args includes:
```shell
--test-coins    Create a Key and allocate test-coins onto it
--pk <pk>       Don\'t generate a key pair and just use the provided public key
--preload <preload>  Preload the key with a coin balance
```
// TODO: Do we need to enable `--anon` functionality here?

#### Key's Balance

Retrieve a given `Key`'s balance using its XorUrl.

Target can be passed as an arg, or retrieved from `stdin`
```
$ safe_cli keys balance <target>
> 33
```

### Wallet

A `Wallet` is a specific type of Container on the network, holding a set of spendable safecoin balances. A `Wallet` effectively contains links to `Key`'s which have safecoin balances attached to them, but the `Wallet` can also store the secret keys needed to spend them. Wallets are stored encrypted and only accessible to the owner by default.

Manage a wallet container and safecoin funds therein.

```shell
SUBCOMMANDS:
    balance     Query a new Wallet or PublicKeys CoinBalance
    #check-tx    Check the status of a given transaction
    create      Create a new Wallet/CoinBalance
    help        Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    insert      Insert a spendable balance into a wallet
    #sweep       Move all coins within a wallet to a given balance
    transfer    Transfer safecoins from one wallet, spendable balance or pk to another.
```

#### Wallet Creates

Create a new wallet container.

```shell
$ safe_cli wallet create --pretty
> Wallet created at: "safe://bbkulcbthsrih6ot7mfwus6oa4xeonv5y7wwm2ucjeypgtwrmdk5db7fqy"
```
#### Wallet Balance

Retrieve a given wallet's balance from the wallet XorUrl. This returns the balance of the whole wallet, including any contains spendable balances, or child wallets.

Target can be passed as an arg, or retrieved from `stdin`
```shell
$ safe_cli wallet balance <target>
> 33
```

#### Wallet Transfer

Transfer an `<amount>` of safecoin `<to>` another wallet, `<from>` a wallet. This currently must be passed as a XorUrl, but `stdin` will be supported later.

Both wallets must have _default_ entries set so far.

```shell
$ safe_cli wallet transfer <amount> <to> <from> --pretty
# eg:
safe://7e0ae5e6ed15a8065ea03218a0903b0be7c9d78384998817331b309e9d23566e safe://6221785c1a20163bbefaf523af15fa525d83b00be7502d28cae5b09ac54f4e75 --pretty
Transaction Success. Tx_id: 44dcd919-0703-4f23-a9a2-6b6be8da0bcc
```

#### Wallet Insert

Insert a public key into a wallet to make it a spendable balance.

```shell
USAGE:
    safe_cli wallet insert [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <source> [ARGS]

OPTIONS:
    --name <name>             The name to give this spendable balance
    -s, --secret-key <secret>     Optionally pass the secret key for the

ARGS:
    <source>     The source wallet for funds
    <target>    The target wallet to store the spendable balance.
    <key>       The existing keys safe://xor-url to add to the wallet
```

- The `<source>` is the wallet paying for data creation.
- The `<target>` is the wallet to insert the spendable balance to.
- The `<key>` allows passing an existing key XorUrl, which we'll be using to generate the spendable balance.
- The `--name` is an optional nickname to give a wallet for easy reference,
- The `--default` flag sets _this_ new spendable balance as the default for the containing wallet.

With the above options, the user will be prompted to input the secret key associated with the public key. This is stored in the wallet.

Otherwise, there's also the `--secret-key` argument which, when combined with `--key` can pass the key as part of the command line instruction itself.

```shell
$ $ safe_cli wallet insert safe://pk-xor-url --target safe://wallet-xorurl --key safe://pk-xor-url --name my_wallet --default --pretty
Enter secret key corresponding to public key at "safe://pk-xor-url": b493a84e3b35239cbffdf10b8ebfa49c0013a5d1b59e5ef3c000320e2d303311
Spendable balance added with name 'my_wallet' in wallet located at "safe://wallet-xorurl"

```
